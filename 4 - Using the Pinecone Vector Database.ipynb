I want to turn to the war in Ukraine we're now two and a half years uh into this conflict Mr President it has been the position of the Biden Administration that we must defend Ukraine from Russia from Vladimir Putin to defend their sovereignty their democracy that it's in America's best interest to do so arguing that if Putin wins he may be embolden to move even further into other countries you have said you would solve this war 24 hours you said so just before the break tonight how exactly would you do that and I want to ask you a very simple question tonight do you want Ukraine to win this War I want the war to stop I want to save lives that are being uselessly people being killed by the millions it's the millions it's so much worse than the numbers that you're getting which are fake numbers look we're in for 250 billion or more because they don't ask Europe which is a much big ger beneficiary to getting this thing done than we are they're in for $150 billion less because Biden and you don't have the courage to ask Europe like I did with NATO they paid billions and billions hundreds of billions of dollars when I said either you pay up or we're not going to protect you anymore so that's maybe one of the reasons they don't like me as much as they like weak people but you take a look at what's happening we're in for 250 to 2 75 billion they're into 100 to 150 they should be forced to equalize with that being said I want to get the War settled I know zalinski very well and I know Putin very well I have a good relationship and they respect your president okay they respect me they don't respect Biden how would you respect him why for what reason he hasn't even made a phone call in two years to Putin hasn't spoken to anybody they don't even try and get it that is a war that's dying to be settled I will get it settled before I even become president if I win when I'm president elect and what I'll do is I'll speak to one I'll speak to the other I'll get them together that war would have never happened and in fact when I saw Putin after I left unfortunately left because our our country has gone to hell but after I left when I saw him building up soldiers he did it after I left I said oh he must be negotiating it must be a good strong point of negotiation well it wasn't because Biden had no idea how to talk to him he had no idea how to stop it and now you have millions of people dead and it's only getting worse and it could lead to World War I don't kid yourself David we're playing with World War III and we have a president that we don't even know if he's where is our president we don't even know if he's a president and just to clarify they threw him out of a campaign like a dog we don't even know is he our president but we have a president Mr that doesn't know he's alive your time is up and with the just to clarify in the question do you believe it's in the US best interest for Ukraine to win this war yes or no I think it's the US best interest to get this war finished and just get it done negotiate a deal because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed I want to take this to vice president Harris I want to get your thoughts on support for Ukraine in this moment but also as commander-in-chief if elected how would you deal with Vladimir Putin and would it be any different from what we're seeing from President Biden well first of all it's important to remind the former president you're not running against Joe Biden you're running against me I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up and that's not who we are as Americans let's understand what happened here um I actually met with zalinski a few days before Russia invaded tried through Force to change territorial boundaries to defy one of the most important International rules and Norms which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity and I met with President zansky I shared with him American intelligence about how he could defend himself days later I went to NATO's Eastern flank to Poland and Romania and through the work that I and others did we brought 50 countries together to support Ukraine in its righteous defense and because of our support because of the air defense the ammunition the artillery the javelins the Abrams tanks that we have provided Ukraine stands as an independent and free country if Donald Trump were President Putin would be sitting in keev right now and understand what that would mean because Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer president and that we understand the import of the greatest military Alliance the world has ever known which is NATO and what we have done to preserve the ability of zalinski and the ukrainians to fight for their independence otherwise Putin would be sitting in keev with his eyes on the rest of Europe starting with Poland and why don't you tell the 800,000 polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch vice president Harris thank you we've heard from both of you on Ukraine tonight Afghanistan came up in the last hour I I wanted her to respond to something you said earlier and I please I'll I'll give you a minute here Putin would be sitting in Moscow and he wouldn't have lost 300,000 men and women but he would have been sitting in Moscow quiet place he would have been sitting in Moscow much happier than he is right now but but eventually you know he's got a thing that other people don't have he's got nuclear weapons they don't ever talk about that he got nuclear weapons nobody ever thinks about that and eventually maybe he'll use him and maybe he hasn't been that threatening but he does have that something we don't even like to talk about nobody likes to talk about it but just so you understand they sent her to negotiate peace before this war started three days later he went in and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid they said the wrong things that war should have never started she was the Emissary they sent her in to negotiate with zalinski and Putin and she did and the war started three days later and that's the kind of talent we have with her she's worse than Biden in my opinion I think he's the worst president in the history of our country she goes down as the worst vice president in the history of our country but let me tell you something she is a horrible negotiator they sent her to negotiate as soon as they left Putin did The Invasion president Trump thank you you did bring up something you said she went to negotiate with Vladimir Putin vice president Harris have you ever met Vladimir Putin can you clarify tonight yet again I said it at the beginning of this debate you're going to hear a bunch of Lies coming from this fellow and that is another one when I went to meet with President zansi I've now met with him over five times the reality is it has been about standing as America always should as a leader upholding International rules and Norms as a leader who shows strength understanding that the alliances we have around the world are dependent on our ability to look out for our friends and not favor our enemies because you adore strong men instead of caring about democracy and that is very much what is at stake here the president of the United States is commanderin-chief and the American people have a right to rely on a president who understands the significance of America's role and responsibility in terms of ensuring that there is stability and ensuring we stand up for our principles and not sell them for the for the benefit of personal flattery we've talked about Ukraine and Vladimir Putin I do want to talk about Afghanistan it came up in in the first hour of this debate I I wanted to move on to Afghanistan Stenberg said Trump did the most amazing thing I've ever seen he got these countries the 28 countries at the time to pay up he said I've never seen he's the head of NATO he said I've never seen for years we were paying almost all of NATO we were being ripped off by European nations both on trade and on NATO I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before if you don't pay we're not going to protect you otherwise we would have never gotten it he said it was one of the most incredible jobs that he's ever seen done thank you I want to turn\")]\n"

continue here and I want to turn to the war in Ukraine we're now two and a half years uh into this conflict Mr President it has been the position of the Biden Administration that we must defend Ukraine from Russia from Vladimir Putin to defend their sovereignty their democracy that it's in America's best interest to do so arguing that if Putin wins he may be embolden to move even further into other countries you have said you would solve this war 24 hours you said so just before the break tonight how exactly would you do that and I want to ask you a very simple question tonight do you want Ukraine to win this War I want the war to stop I want to save lives that are being uselessly people being killed by the millions it's the millions it's so much worse than the numbers that you're getting which are fake numbers look we're in for 250 billion or more because they don't ask Europe which is a much big ger beneficiary to getting this thing done than we are they're in for $150 billion less because Biden and you don't have the courage to ask Europe like I did with NATO they paid billions and billions hundreds of billions of dollars when I said either you pay up or we're not going to protect you anymore so that's maybe one of the reasons they don't like me as much as they like weak people but you take a look at what's happening we're in for 250 to 2 75 billion they're into 100 to 150 they should be forced to equalize with that being said I want to get the War settled I know zalinski very well and I know Putin very well I have a good relationship and they respect your president okay they respect me they don't respect Biden how would you respect him why for what reason he hasn't even made a phone call in two years to Putin hasn't spoken to anybody they don't even try and get it that is a war that's dying to be settled I will get it settled before I even become president if I win when I'm president elect and what I'll do is I'll speak to one I'll speak to the other I'll get them together that war would have never happened and in fact when I saw Putin after I left unfortunately left because our our country has gone to hell but after I left when I saw him building up soldiers he did it after I left I said oh he must be negotiating it must be a good strong point of negotiation well it wasn't because Biden had no idea how to talk to him he had no idea how to stop it and now you have millions of people dead and it's only getting worse and it could lead to World War I don't kid yourself David we're playing with World War III and we have a president that we don't even know if he's where is our president we don't even know if he's a president and just to clarify they threw him out of a campaign like a dog we don't even know is he our president but we have a president Mr that doesn't know he's alive your time is up and with the just to clarify in the question do you believe it's in the US best interest for Ukraine to win this war yes or no I think it's the US best interest to get this war finished and just get it done negotiate a deal because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed I want to take this to vice president Harris I want to get your thoughts on support for Ukraine in this moment but also as commander-in-chief if elected how would you deal with Vladimir Putin and would it be any different from what we're seeing from President Biden well first of all it's important to remind the former president you're not running against Joe Biden you're running against me I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up and that's not who we are as Americans let's understand what happened here um I actually met with zalinski a few days before Russia invaded tried through Force to change territorial boundaries to defy one of the most important International rules and Norms which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity and I met with President zansky I shared with him American intelligence about how he could defend himself days later I went to NATO's Eastern flank to Poland and Romania and through the work that I and others did we brought 50 countries together to support Ukraine in its righteous defense and because of our support because of the air defense the ammunition the artillery the javelins the Abrams tanks that we have provided Ukraine stands as an independent and free country if Donald Trump were President Putin would be sitting in keev right now and understand what that would mean because Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer president and that we understand the import of the greatest military Alliance the world has ever known which is NATO and what we have done to preserve the ability of zalinski and the ukrainians to fight for their independence otherwise Putin would be sitting in keev with his eyes on the rest of Europe starting with Poland and why don't you tell the 800,000 polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch vice president Harris thank you we've heard from both of you on Ukraine tonight Afghanistan came up in the last hour I I wanted her to respond to something you said earlier and I please I'll I'll give you a minute here Putin would be sitting in Moscow and he wouldn't have lost 300,000 men and women but he would have been sitting in Moscow quiet place he would have been sitting in Moscow much happier than he is right now but but eventually you know he's got a thing that other people don't have he's got nuclear weapons they don't ever talk about that he got nuclear weapons nobody ever thinks about that and eventually maybe he'll use him and maybe he hasn't been that threatening but he does have that something we don't even like to talk about nobody likes to talk about it but just so you understand they sent her to negotiate peace before this war started three days later he went in and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid they said the wrong things that war should have never started she was the Emissary they sent her in to negotiate with zalinski and Putin and she did and the war started three days later and that's the kind of talent we have with her she's worse than Biden in my opinion I think he's the worst president in the history of our country she goes down as the worst vice president in the history of our country but let me tell you something she is a horrible negotiator they sent her to negotiate as soon as they left Putin did The Invasion president Trump thank you you did bring up something you said she went to negotiate with Vladimir Putin vice president Harris have you ever met Vladimir Putin can you clarify tonight yet again I said it at the beginning of this debate you're going to hear a bunch of Lies coming from this fellow and that is another one when I went to meet with President zansi I've now met with him over five times the reality is it has been about standing as America always should as a leader upholding International rules and Norms as a leader who shows strength understanding that the alliances we have around the world are dependent on our ability to look out for our friends and not favor our enemies because you adore strong men instead of caring about democracy and that is very much what is at stake here the president of the United States is commanderin-chief and the American people have a right to rely on a president who understands the significance of America's role and responsibility in terms of ensuring that there is stability and ensuring we stand up for our principles and not sell them for the for the benefit of personal flattery we've talked about Ukraine and Vladimir Putin I do want to talk about Afghanistan it came up in in the first hour of this debate I I wanted to move on to Afghanistan Stenberg said Trump did the most amazing thing I've ever seen he got these countries the 28 countries at the time to pay up he said I've never seen he's the head of NATO he said I've never seen for years we were paying almost all of NATO we were being ripped off by European nations both on trade and on NATO I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before if you don't pay we're not going to protect you otherwise we would have never gotten it he said it was one of the most incredible jobs that he's ever seen done thank you I want to turn\")]"

understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer president and that we understand the import of the greatest military Alliance the world has ever known which is NATO and what we have done to preserve the ability of zalinski and the ukrainians to fight for their independence otherwise Putin would be sitting in keev with his eyes on the rest of Europe starting with Poland and why don't you tell the 800,000 polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch vice president Harris thank you we've heard from both of you on Ukraine tonight Afghanistan came up in the last hour I I wanted her to respond to something you said earlier and I please I'll I'll give you a minute here Putin would be sitting in Moscow and he wouldn't have lost 300,000 men and women but he would have been sitting in Moscow quiet place he would have been sitting in Moscow much happier than he is right now but but eventually you know he's got a thing that other people don't have he's got nuclear weapons they don't ever talk about that he got nuclear weapons nobody ever thinks about that and eventually maybe he'll use him and maybe he hasn't been that threatening but he does have that something we don't even like to talk about nobody likes to talk about it but just so you understand they sent her to negotiate peace before this war started three days later he went in and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid they said the wrong things that war should have never started she was the Emissary they sent her in to negotiate with zalinski and Putin and she did and the war started three days later and that's the kind of talent we have with her she's worse than Biden in my opinion I think he's the worst president in the history of our country she goes down as the worst vice president in the history of our country but let me tell you something she is a horrible negotiator they sent her to negotiate as soon as they left Putin did The Invasion president Trump thank you you did bring up something you said she went to negotiate with Vladimir Putin vice president Harris have you ever met Vladimir Putin can you clarify tonight yet again I said it at the beginning of this debate you're going to hear a bunch of Lies coming from this fellow and that is another one when I went to meet with President zansi I've now met with him over five times the reality is it has been about standing as America always should as a leader upholding International rules and Norms as a leader who shows strength understanding that the alliances we have around the world are dependent on our ability to look out for our friends and not favor our enemies because you adore strong men instead of caring about democracy and that is very much what is at stake here the president of the United States is commanderin-chief and the American people have a right to rely on a president who understands the significance of America's role and responsibility in terms of ensuring that there is stability and ensuring we stand up for our principles and not sell them for the for the benefit of personal flattery we've talked about Ukraine and Vladimir Putin I do want to talk about Afghanistan it came up in in the first hour of this debate I I wanted to move on to Afghanistan Stenberg said Trump did the most amazing thing I've ever seen he got these countries the 28 countries at the time to pay up he said I've never seen he's the head of NATO he said I've never seen for years we were paying almost all of NATO we were being ripped off by European nations both on trade and on NATO I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before if you don't pay we're not going to protect you otherwise we would have never gotten it he said it was one of the most incredible jobs that he's ever seen done thank you I want to turn\n",
