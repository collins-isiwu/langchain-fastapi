       "'New York City is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in southeastern New York State, and is positioned approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston. The city is primarily built on three islands: Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island, and it has grown in significance as a trading port due to its location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which leads into a naturally sheltered harbor and the Atlantic Ocean.\\n\\nCulturally, New York City is often regarded as the cultural capital of the world, serving as the birthplace of various cultural movements such as the Harlem Renaissance, abstract expressionism, and several music genres including hip-hop, punk, and disco. The city is noted for its fast pace, leading to the popular phrase \"New York minute,\" and its residents are recognized for their resilience, particularly in the aftermath of events like the September 11 terrorist attacks and the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, New York was voted the world\\'s most resilient city in 2021 and 2022 according to a global poll by Time Out.'"
